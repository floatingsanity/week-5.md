### 5 similarities between the open-wc repo structure and your react / vue / angular structures
All of them typically have a "src" directory for the application source code.
They use package.json (or equivalent) for managing dependencies and scripts.
Each may have a "components" or "views" directory for organizing UI elements.
Build configurations often reside in separate configuration files, like webpack.config.js, vue.config.js, or angular.json.
Testing directories such as "tests" or "spec" for unit and integration tests are common in all.
### Was this easier, harder, or the same difficulty as exploring the frameworks?
It's generally easier to explore the repo structure of these frameworks since they share some common concepts and patterns. However, the difficulty may vary depending on your prior experience and familiarity with web development
### Any concept, structure, terminology, etc that you're struggling with and need additional guidance at the end of this homework / 1st 5 weeks (1/3 of course)
I don't struggle with usuing anything as long as I don't have outside issues that are not common with my peers
